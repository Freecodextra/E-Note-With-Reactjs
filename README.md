## Documentation

[Documentation](https://##Documentation)

This react app is my first react project. In this app, there are to input fields imported to App.jsx as a component from an input.jsx file.

The states of these input fields are monitored and can be held unto using the event.target property.
The input values are then added to the array of items, which is then re-rendered on the page.

With the use of React hook (useState), the app updates immediately a new object is added to the array of items.

Also, useRef is used to denote if the edit button was clicked so that the add button will only update the affected Note and won't add any object into the array.

This project has made me learnt a lot about React and I'm hoping to know more.

## Features

- Edit and Delete Notes
- Add New Note
- Update Existing Note
